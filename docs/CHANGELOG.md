## [Unreleased]

## [fix/admin-mobile-responsive] — 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- Admin panel mobile layout: collapsible sidebar with PageShiftWrapper-style animation (translateX(80vw), shadow, border-radius) matching regular mobile nav
- Admin Dashboard link missing from mobile nav drawer (SidebarDrawer) — now visible for admin users with correct active state via `pathname.startsWith('/admin')`
- TeacherRequests and StudentsList tables now horizontally scrollable on mobile (`overflow-x-auto`, `min-w` on table)
- Search inputs now full-width on mobile (`flex-1`), fixed width on desktop (`md:w-64 md:flex-none`)
- Admin sidebar was independently scrollable — removed `overflow-y-auto` from nav to match regular sidebar behavior
- Main page content locked (non-scrollable) when admin sidebar is open
- Hamburger button in AdminHeader now `w-12 h-12` matching regular Navbar hamburger size

### Added
- AdminHeader: hamburger button (mobile-only) with `onToggleSidebar` prop
- Mobile-First Responsive Design section added to `docs/CLAUDE.md` with 8 specific rules for tables, search inputs, filter buttons, and admin layout

### Added
- `TeacherApplication` SQLAlchemy model (`backend/app/models/teacher_application.py`) — `teacher_applications` table with UUID PK, applicant fields (name, email, phone, subject_area, qualifications, experience_years, teaching_philosophy), status tracking (pending/approved/rejected/registered), admin review fields, and FK references to `users` table
- Alembic migration for `teacher_applications` table with CHECK constraints on `subject_area` and `status`, email index, and foreign keys to `users`
- `InviteToken` SQLAlchemy model (`backend/app/models/invite_token.py`) — `invite_tokens` table with UUID PK, 64-char unique token, email, FK to `teacher_applications`, expiry timestamp, and used_at tracking
- Alembic migration for `invite_tokens` table with unique token index and FK to `teacher_applications`
- `create_admin` CLI command (`backend/app/cli/create_admin.py`) — server-side only script to provision admin accounts via `python -m app.cli.create_admin --name --email --password`; uses bcrypt hashing, duplicate email check, min 8-char password validation
- `require_admin` and `require_teacher` FastAPI dependencies (`backend/app/dependencies/roles.py`) — role-based access control that builds on `get_current_user`; returns 403 Forbidden if authenticated user lacks the required role
- Pydantic request/response schemas for teacher applications (`backend/app/schemas/application.py`) — covers submit, status check, admin list/detail/approve/reject/resend, and invite token validation
- Invite token service (`backend/app/services/invite_service.py`) — generate (256-bit cryptographic token, 72h expiry, auto-invalidates old tokens), validate (checks expired/used/invalid), and consume (marks as used) logic
- Public application API routes (`backend/app/routers/applications.py`) — `POST /api/applications` (submit with duplicate-pending/approved checks) and `GET /api/applications/status` (check by email + application_id)
- Admin application API routes (`backend/app/routers/admin.py`) — 5 endpoints: paginated list (search by name/email, filter by status, 10/page), full detail (with invite token status), approve (generates invite token), reject (optional reason), resend invite (invalidates old token)
- `docs/become-a-teacher-architecture.md` — complete 19-PR architecture plan for gated teacher onboarding pipeline (application form → admin review → invite token → teacher signup → onboarding)
- Full API request/response schemas for all 11 endpoints (public, admin, modified auth)
- Admin pagination specification (10/page, newest first, searchable by name/email, status filter)
- Admin notification email on new teacher applications (sent to all admin-role users from DB)
- `GET /api/auth/validate-invite?token=` endpoint — read-only invite token validation, returns applicant name/email if valid or reason (expired/used/invalid) if not
- Email service (`backend/app/services/email_service.py`) using Resend Python SDK — 4 email functions: application received (to applicant), new application (to all admins), application approved (invite link with 72h expiry), application rejected (with optional reason); all fire-and-forget (failures logged, never block the operation)
- `resend_api_key`, `email_from`, and `frontend_url` settings in `config.py` + `.env.example` — empty API key disables emails in development
- `FormTextarea` component (`src/components/common/FormTextarea/`) — textarea with label, error state, character count, configurable rows and maxLength; follows FormInput pattern with Tailwind styling
- 14 new tests for `FormTextarea` — total now 191 tests across 28 suites

- `/become-a-teacher` page (`app/become-a-teacher/`, `src/views/BecomeATeacher/`) — public application form (RHF + Zod) with 7 fields: name, email, phone, subject area (radio), experience years, qualifications, teaching philosophy; shows success card with application ID on submit, server error banner on failure
- `applicationService.ts` (`src/services/applicationService.ts`) — `submitApplication()` and `checkApplicationStatus()` API calls (axios, follows authService pattern)
- Types added to `src/types/index.ts` — `TApplicationStatus`, `TSubjectArea`, `ITeacherApplication`, `IApplicationSubmitResponse`, `IApplicationStatusCheck`, `IInviteValidation`

- 16 new tests for admin shell components — total now 265 tests across 36 suites
- `TeacherRequests` view (`src/views/Admin/TeacherRequests/`) — paginated table of teacher applications with search by name/email, status filter tabs (All / Pending / Approved / Rejected / Registered), Previous/Next pagination, and per-row View link
- `TeacherRequestDetail` view (`src/views/Admin/TeacherRequestDetail/`) — full applicant profile card (name, email, phone, subject, experience, qualifications, teaching philosophy, admin notes, invite expiry); shows `StatusBadge`; refresh on action; Back to requests link
- `ApplicationActions` component (`src/components/admin/ApplicationActions/`) — approve (pending → sends invite), reject with optional reason textarea, resend invite (approved → new token); each action guarded by a `Modal` confirmation; inline success/error messages

- `IAuthContext.signup` type updated with optional `inviteToken?` parameter
- `app/signup/page.tsx` wrapped in `<Suspense>` to support `useSearchParams()` in the client component
- `/signup` invite token flow — detects `?invite=<token>` in URL, validates the token via API, then: **valid token** → shows "Complete Your Registration" form with name+email pre-filled (locked, readOnly) and includes token in register request, redirects to `/teacher/onboarding` on success; **invalid/expired/used token** → hides form entirely, shows inline error card (title + detail message) with a "Check Application Status" link to `/application-status`
- 13 new tests for invite signup flow across 4 describe blocks (valid token, expired, used, invalid) — total now 306 tests across 39 suites
- `src/services/teacherService.ts` — `submitOnboarding(data: IOnboardingData)` API function calling `POST /api/teacher/onboarding`; swap-ready for real FastAPI backend + Supabase Storage photo upload

- `RegisterRequest` schema updated with optional `invite_token: str` field
- Moved all project docs (CLAUDE.md, architecture.md, brainstorm.md, deployment-workflow.md, project_status.md, CHANGELOG.md, vercel-deployment-plan.md) from project root into `docs/` folder — README.md stays at root
- Fixed `.env.example` link in CLAUDE.md to point to `../backend/.env.example`
- **Replaced Cloudinary with Supabase Storage** for all file storage (teacher photos, future CV uploads) across all docs, config, and architecture files
